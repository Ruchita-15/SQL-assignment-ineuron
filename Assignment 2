1. Create an ‘Orders’ table which comprises of these columns –‘order_id’, ‘order_date’, ‘amount’, ‘customer_id’ 
sol: create table Orders(
     order_id int,
     order_date date,
     amount int,
     customer_id int
);


2. Make an inner join on ‘Customer’ & ‘Order’ tables on the ‘customer_id’ column
Sol: Select * from orders
     INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id; 
  

3. Make left and right joins on ‘Customer’ & ‘Order’ tables on the ‘customer_id’ column
Sol:  Select * from orders left join Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id; 

       Select * from orders right join Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id; 
      

4. Update the ‘Orders’ table, set the amount to be 100 where ‘customer_id’ is 3
Ans : update orders set amount = '100' where customer_id = '3'
